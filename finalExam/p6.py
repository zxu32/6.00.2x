def find_combination(choices, total):
    """
    choices: a non-empty list of ints
    total: a positive int

    Returns result, a numpy.array of length len(choices)
    such that
        * each element of result is 0 or 1
        * sum(result*choices) == total
        * sum(result) is as small as possible
    In case of ties, returns any result that works.
    If there is no result that gives the exact total,
    pick the one that gives sum(result*choices) closest
    to total without going over.
